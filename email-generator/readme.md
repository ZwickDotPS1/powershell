This is a script to generate an email formatted to work with SBI's in-house built ticketing system.

I was planning to expand it with up to 10 other common emails I would write, but I ended up using the 'Canned Responses' feature in Gmail instead. It turned out to be quicker, but I kept this script around to use it as a snippet for other scripts later.
